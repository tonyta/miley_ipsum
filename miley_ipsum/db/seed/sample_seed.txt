round and round and away we go
round and round and away we go
four by four and away we go
high not low and away we go
round and round and away we go
and away we go and away we go
four by four and away we go
high not low and away we go
i'm a female rebel who can't you tell
who can't you tell who can't you tell
i'm a female rebel who can't you tell
who can't you tell who can't you tell
i probably shouldn't say this
but at times i get so scared
when i think about the previous
relationship we've shared
it was awesome but we lost it
it's not possible for me not to care
and now we're standing in the rain
but nothing's ever gonna change until you hear my dear
the 7 things i hate about you
the 7 things i hate about you oh you
you're vain your games you're insecure
you love me you like her
you make me laugh you make me cry
i don't know which side to buy

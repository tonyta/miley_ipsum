i'm a female rebel who can't you tell
who can't you tell who can't you tell
i'm a female rebel who can't you tell
who can't you tell who can't you tell
i probably shouldn't say this
but at times i get so scared
when i think about the previous
relationship we've shared
it was awesome but we lost it
it's not possible for me not to care
and now we're standing in the rain
but nothing's ever gonna change until you hear my dear
the 7 things i hate about you
the 7 things i hate about you oh you
you're vain your games you're insecure
you love me you like her
you make me laugh you make me cry
i don't know which side to buy
your friends they're jerks
and when you act like them just know it hurts
i wanna be with the one i know
and the 7th thing i hate the most that you do
you make me love you
it's awkward and silent
as i wait for you to say
but what i need to hear now
is your sincere apology
and when you mean it i'll believe it
if you text it i'll delete it
let's be clear
oh i'm not coming back
you're taking 7 steps here
and compared to all the great things
that would take too long to write
i probably should mention
the 7 that i like
the 7 things i like about you
your hair your eyes your old levi's
and when we kiss i'm hypnotized
you make me laugh you make me cry
but i guess that's both i'll have to buy
your hand in mine
when we're intertwined everything's alright
i want to be
with the one i know
and the 7th thing i like the most that you do
you make me love you
you do oh
oh hey oh
baby baby are you listening
wondering where you've been all my life
i just started living
oh baby are you listening
when you say you love me
know i love you more
and when you say you need me
know i need you more
boy i adore you i adore you
baby can you hear me
when i'm crying out for you
i'm scared oh so scared
but when you're near me
i feel like i'm standing with an army
of men armed with weapons hey oh
when you say you love me
know i love you more
and when you say you need me
know i need you more
boy i adore you i adore you
i love lying next to you
i could do this for eternity
you and mewe're meant to be
in holy matrimony
god knew exactly what he was doing
when he led me to you
when you say you love me
know i love you more i love you more
and when you say you need me
know i need you more
boy i adore you i adore you
when you say you love me
know i love you more
and when you say you need me
know i need you more
boy i adore you i adore you
i know this isnt what i wanted
never thought it'd come this far
just thinking back to where we started
 how we lost all that we are
we were young  times were easy
but i could see it's not the same
i'm standing here but you don't see me
i'd give it all for that to change
and i dont want to lose her
i dont want to let her go
i'm standing out in the rain
i need to know if its over
cause i will leave you alone
flooded with all this pain
knowing that i'll never hold her
like i did before the storm
and with every strike of lightning
comes a memory that lasts
not a word is left unspoken as the thunder starts to crash
maybe i should give up
i'm standing out in the rain
i need to know if its over
cause i will leave you alone
flooded with all this pain
knowing that i'll never hold her
like i did before the storm
trying to keep the light from going in
and the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
we always say a heart is not whole without the one who gets you through the storm
standing out in the rain knowing that it's really over- please don't leave me alone
flooded with all this pain knowing that i'll never hold you like i did before the storm
it's been in the past for a while
i get a flash and i smile
am i crazy
still miss you baby
it was real it was right
but it burned too hot to survive
all that's left is
all these ashes
where does the love go
i don't know
when it's all said and done
how could i be losing you forever
after all the time we spent together
i have to know why
i had to lose you
now you've just become
like everything i'll never find again
at the bottom of the ocean
do do do
do do do do
do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do
in a dream you appeared
for a while you were here
so i keep sleeping
just to keep you with me
i'll draw a map
connect the dots
with all the memories that i've got
what i'm missing
i'll keep re-living
where does the love go
i don't know
when it's all said and done
how could i be losing you forever
after all the time we spent together
i have to know why
i had to lose you
now you've just become
like everything i'll never find again
at the bottom of the ocean
this is it
let go
breathe
you don't have to love me
for me to baby ever understand
just know i love the time that we both had
and i don't ever want to see you sad be happy
cause i don't want to hold you
if you don't want to tell me you love me babe
just know i'm gonna have to walk away
i'll be big enough for both of us to say be happy

drive my heart into the night 
you can drop the keys off in the morning 
in the morning 
cause i don't want to leave home without your love 
without it 
you told me that you wanted this 
i told you it was all yours 
if you're done with it 
then what you say forever for 
if forevers out the door 
i'll ignore when you call 
drive my heart into the night
yeah
you can drop the keys off in the morning 
in the morning 
cause i don't want to leave home without your love 
without it 
you told me you were coming back 
right back 
promised it was real and i believed that 
but if i fall for it again 
i will be a fool 
if our love is at the end 
then why do i still want you 
yeah
but i guess i got no valentine 
send me roses i just let 'em die
i was crazy thinking you were mine
it was all just a lie 
drive my heart into the night 
you can drop the keys off in the morning 
cause i don't want to leave home without your love 
without it 
i always knew i never wanted this
i never thought it could happen 
you acted like you wanted this
but then you led me on 
i thought you would be there when i go 
you promised you would be there when i go 
but all the broken promises i won't miss 
i'm finished 
all i know are the facts 
that when i look you in the eyes 
all i see are the lies 
been there done that 
drive my heart into the night 
you can drop the keys off in the morning 
in the morning 
cause i don't want to leave home without your love 
without it
we both lie silently still
in the dead of the night
although we both lie close together
we feel miles apart inside
was it something i said or something i did
did my words not come out right
though i tried not to hurt you
yeah i tried
but i guess that's why they say
every rose has its thorn
just like every night has its dawn
just like every cowboy sings his sad sad song
every rose has its thorn
yeah it does
i listen to our favorite song
playing on the radio
hear the dj say loves a game of easy come and easy go
but i wonder does he know
has he ever felt like this
and i know that you'd be here right now
if i could let you know somehow
though it's been a while now
i can still feel so much pain
like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
but that scar that scar remains
i know i could've saved a love that night
if i'd known what to say
instead of makin' love
we both made our separate ways
and now i hear you found somebody new
and that i never meant that much to you
and to hear that tears me up inside
and to see you cuts me like a knife
you don't understand what it is
that makes me tick
but you wish you did
you always second guesswonder if i say yes
but you just lose out every time
if you only knew what i talked about
when i'm with my friends just hangin' out
then you'd have the inside scoop
on what to say what to do
that way when you play the game
baby you could never lose
don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall
a creepy little sneaky little fly on the wall
all my precious secrets yeah
you'd know them all
don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall
you'd love to know the things i do
when i'm with my friends and not with you
your always second guess wonder if
there's other guys im flirting with
you should know by now
if you were my boyfriend i'd be true to you
if i make a promise i'm comin' thru
don't you wish that you could
see me every second of the day
that way you would have no doubt
that baby i would never stray
don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall
a creepy little sneaky little fly on the wall
all my precious secrets yeah
you'd know them all
don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall
a little communication
well that'll go a long way
you're getting misinformation
too much hearsay hearsay
and what i say is
come a little closer
and what i'm gonna say is
don't you
don't you
don't you
don't you wish you were a
hey
don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall
a creepy little sneaky little fly on the wall
all my precious secrets yeah
you'd know them all
don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall
imagining you're far away
just searching for the words to say
i feel it when you fall apart
our lives are our greatest art
i don't wanna change your mind
coz i accept you for everything you are and will be
stay here with me now
the only thing that our hearts are made of
are the acts of forgiveness and love
the only thing real when push comes to shove
are the acts of forgiveness and love
'cause in the end no one loses or wins
the story begins again and again
with forgiveness and love
you don't ever have to read my mind
you can see it when you close your eyes
don't believe it when you lose your faith
another moment is a moment away
i can't tell you what the future holds
or how to live
all i know is what feels right lights up my life again and again
the only thing that our hearts are made of
are the acts of forgiveness and love
the only thing real when push comes to shove
are the acts of forgiveness and love
'cause in the end no one loses or wins
the story begins again and again
with forgiveness and love
let's jump the sun
let's find forever
where does the time go
just live your life
you'll get another today today today
forgiveness and love
'cause in the end no one loses or wins
the story begins again and again
with forgiveness and love
let's jump the sun 
these four walls
they whisper to me
they know a secret
i knew they would not keep
it didn't take long
for the room to fill with dust
and these four walls came down around us
it must have been something to send me out of my head
with the words so radical and not what i meant
now i wait
for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
just me and these four walls again
it's hard now to let you be
i won't make excuses
i've made my peace
it didn't take long
for me to lose the trust
'cause these four walls
were not strong enough
it must have been something to send me out of my head
with the words so radical and not what i meant
now i wait
for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
just me and these four walls again
yeah
it's difficult
watching us fade
knowing it's all my fault
my mistake
yeah and it's difficult
letting you down
knowing it's all my fault
you're not around
it must have been something to send me out of my head
with the words so radical and not what i meant
now i wait
for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
just me and these four walls again
oh you broke my heart
i told you i was weak for love
but then you went around
and did what you wanted to do
and now i'm crying crying

these memories come back to life
and i don't mind
i remember when we kissed
i still feel it on my lips
the time that you danced with me
with no music playing
i remember the simple things
i remember till i cry
but the one thing i wish i'd forget
the memory i wanna forget
is goodbye
i woke up this morning
and played our song
and through my tears i sang along
i picked up the phone and then
put it down
'cause i know i'm wasting my time
and i don't mind
i remember when we kissed
i still feel it on my lips
the time that you danced with me
with no music playing
i remember the simple things
i remember till i cry
but the one thing i wish i'd forget
the memory i wanna forget
suddenly my cell phone's blowing up
with your ring tone
i hesitate but answer it anyway
you sound so alone
and i'm surprised to hear you say
you remember when we kissed
you still feel it on your lips
the time that you danced with me
with no music playing
you remember the simple things
we talk till we cry
you said that your biggest regret
the one thing you wish i'd forget
is saying goodbye
saying goodbye
oh goodbye
let me see your hands in the air ohhh
i remember dreaming bout
the things i do right now
like i climbed on to a cloud
scared to look back down
i remember when
i was all alone
nobody round
to hold me down
but now you're here with me tonight
look at what you found
i was lonely for some time
now it's only you and i
i won't leave without your love tonight tonight
i'm dancing
to the sound
of my words in the crowd
too high to come down
so let me see your hands in the air 
let me see your hands in the air
let me see your hands in the air
it's go hard or go home and it ain't no lookin' back
my toughest enemy's is in the mirror would you look at that
i'm top five dead or alive one of the best to rhyme
and if i ever take a seat i stood the test of time
every verse every song every feature i was on
better know that i abused it
if i die before my time i'll still be living through my music
i cracked the industry open but still got this shit on lock
even on the highway up to heaven luda still would be on top
i'm dancing
to the sound
of my words in the crowd
too high to come down
so let me see your hands in the air
let me see your hands in the air
let me see your hands in the air

hovering
you always said that we'd make it through
trembling
stumbling
fumbling
for the words that say
that i'm leaving you
i'm leaving you
we go through the motions 
like everything's settled
but it's inside out
and it makes us uncomfortable
still holding on
when there's all this doubt hovering
hovering
hovering 
hovering
you always said that we'd make it through
trembling
stumbling
fumbling
for the words that say
that i'm leaving you
i'm leaving you
and maybe we're just older older
just a little older older
cause the fact that this is over
the fact that this is over with you then
hovering
hovering 
hovering
you always said that we'd make it through
trembling
stumbling
fumbling
for the words that say
that i'm leaving you
leaving you
trembling
stumbling
fumbling
for the words that say
that i'm leaving you

nothing's changed no one can take your place
it gets harder everyday
say you love me more than you did before
and i'm sorry it's this way
but i'm coming home i'll be coming home
and if you ask me i will stay i will stay

hoping you're doing the same
and somehow i feel closer and i can hear you say

after 12 not so well
won't pretend it's too soon to tell
what's round this bend
no disgrace about face
anything not to have to chase you down again
you know nothing hurts like loosing
when you know it's really gone
except for the pain of choosing
to hold too long
i tried it your way
but i got nothing to show
it's been the same same
and the story's getting old
so i guess the driveway
will be the end of the road
for us it's too late
let the credits start to roll
a lot to say
but not today
let the radio break the silence
as we drive
a kiss goodbye
not this time
don't remember what about this song
i ever liked
you know nothing hurts like loosing
when you know i'm already gone
except for the pain of choosing
to hold too long
i tried it your way
but i got nothing to show
it's been the same same
and the story's getting old
so i guess the driveway
will be the end of the road
for us it's too late
let the credits start to roll
i thought maybe we were getting somewhere
but we're still nowhere at all
i watched your tail lights fading
i try but it still won't fall
i remember what it feels like to know love
and have it taken away
can't think of what i've learned right now
but i'll be thanking you someday
i tried it your way
but i got nothing to show
it's been the same same
and the story's getting old
so i guess the driveway
will be the end of the road
for us it's too late
let the credits start to roll
let the credits start to roll
so i guess the driveway
will be the end of the road
end of the road
seems like were holding on forever

i've seen love go by my door
it's never been this close before
never been so easy or so slow
i've been shooting in the dark too long
when something not right it's wrong
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
dragon clouds so high above
i've only known careless love
it's always hit me from below
this time around it's more correct
right on target so direct
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
purple clover queen anne lace
crimson hair across your face
you could make me cry if you don't know
can't remember what i was thinking of
you might be spoiling me too much love
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
blue river running slow and lazy
i could stay with you forever
and never realize the time
situations have ended sad
relationships have all been bad
mine've been like verlaine's and rimbaud
but there's no way i can compare
all those scenes to this affair
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
you're gonna make me wonder what i'm doing
staying far behind without you
you're gonna make me wonder what i'm saying
make me give myself a good talking to
i'll look for you in old honolulu
san francisco ashtabula
you're gonna have to leave me now i know
but i'll see you in the sky above
in the tall grass in the ones i love
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
